    ['name'=> 'Adonna Khare', 'description'=> 'Adonna Khare is an American carbon-pencil artist known for life-size photo-realistic illustrations.\n\nAdonna\'s style has been compared to the photo-realistic illustrations of Audubon, but the surreal worlds and strange inhabitants she creates can spring only from her imagination. Her life-size works, which she is focusing on more and more, possess the scope of a painting, but with enough detail and realism to give viewers the impression they can step through the paper and into Adonna\'s worlds. Though she stays steadfast to her chosen mediums, pencil and paper, her work spans from 8" x 11" to massive murals covering entire walls. She says of her process, "I draw how one might sculpt," and the final artworks contain far more layers of pencil than the surface belies. A review of her in-progress pieces reveal hints of skeleton, almost as if she is drawing her fictional subjects from the inside out.\n\n She has been featured in the Los Angeles Times, NPR, the Huffington Post, Juxtapoz Magazine, Mashable, My Modern Met, and more. Her work has been exhibited at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Boise Art Museum, Minneapolis Institute of Art, Grand Rapids Art Museum, Long Beach Museum of Art, Yellowstone Art Museum, and others. Her works are in numerous prestigious private and museum collections around the world. Adonna holds a master of fine arts degree from California State University, Long Beach.

    ['name'=> 'Steve Rennie', 'description'=> 'Steve Rennie is a music industry expert, having promoted and managed bands such as Mötley Crüe and Incubus.\n\nSteve Rennie began his music career working as a booking agent at USC. After dropping out of college in 1980, and being passed over for a job in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency, he decided to start his own concert promotion company called Steve Rennie Presents. For the next 2½ years he promoted a number of up and coming new wave bands, including The Motels, The Plimsouls, Adam Ant, X, The Blasters, Mötley Crüe, and INXS, in secondary markets outside LA. On New Year\'s Eve 1983, he had his first big breakthrough in LA, booking The Motels at the Beverly Theater in Beverly Hills, getting the nod to promote the show over the big promoters in town. By 1983, he had caught the attention of Southern California\'s leading concert promoter, Avalon Attractions, which offered him a chance to join the company. Steve accepted and soon rose in the ranks to become the senior vice president of Avalon Attractions.\n\nIn 1990, he left Avalon Attractions to start his first incarnation of REN Management Corporation, an artist management firm where he managed a number of top alternative bands, including Dramarama, The Wonder Stuff, Ned\'s Atomic Dustbin, The The, and Primal Scream. In 1994, he accepted an offer from then Epic Records president and current One Direction manager Richard Griffiths. Steve became senior vice president and general manager at Epic Records, where he met and helped sign a young So Cal band called Incubus. He took the band under his wing and helped them build the foundation of what became one of the most successful alt rock bands of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIn 1998, Steve left Epic to become one of the founding members of one of the pioneering Internet music startups, ARTISTdirect. When he informed the members of Incubus that he would be leaving Epic to join his friends Marc Geiger and Don Muller at ARTISTdirect, guitarist Mike Einziger asked Steve to comanage the band with their then manager, Mark Shoffner. He accepted the offer and stayed at ARTISTdirect until 2000, when he left the company to manage Incubus on a full-time basis. Shortly thereafter, the band released their breakthrough, multiplatinum-selling album Make Yourself. Over the next 14 years, the band went on to have a #1 Billboard Top 100 album, a #2 Top 100 album, and a dozen Top 10 alternative radio hits. During his tenure as manager, Incubus built a huge live-touring business and one of the most dedicated and loyal fan bases in the music scene. In January 2014, the band and Steve parted company. Today, all of Steve\'s focus is on his new venture, RenmanMB, which is a mecca for all aspiring artists and music business professionals to come and learn the "real" music business from some of the smartest, most talented, and successful people in the music industry.', 'img'=> 'https://cdn.lynda.com/authors/5826925_250x250_thumb.jpg?v=2142685744'],

One afternoon while putting together a chart for a book, they began to wonder why no one was charting anything fun. They\'d seen interminable pie charts on PowerPoint slides but had never seen a chart of, say, cocktail ingredients. Or the "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." Moreover, while they\'d collaborated with authors to bring ideas to the printed page, they hadn\'t yet worked on anything that was fully theirs. So Patrick used his editorial background to do research, and Ben used his design expertise to lay out the charts. In September 2010, Ben and Patrick launched PopChartLab.com with two posters for sale: a taxonomy of rapper names and a family tree of beer varieties.

    ['name'=> 'Chris Landreth', 'description'=> 'Oscar-winning filmmaker Chris Landreth is a CG pioneer who works with clients like DreamWorks and LinkedIn.\n\nWhen Chris was a young boy, he was given a battery of psychological tests to determine what he might be when he grew up. He was found to have "mixed brain dominance." When Chris later discovered computers, he found that while he used a tablet with his left hand, he used a mouse with his right. This mixed-up brain behavior has since become a staple of Chris\'s career path. He first flexed his left brain to receive an MS degree in theoretical and applied mechanics from the University of Illinois. Then he helped develop a fluid measurement technique called particle image velocimetry.\n\nBut soon enough, Chris\'s right brain asserted itself. He discovered computer animation when he met Professor Donna Cox at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). Chris then created his first short film, The Listener (1991). Chris decided then that animation was the best way to entertain both sides of his brain.\n\nIn 1994, Chris joined Alias Inc. (now Autodesk Inc.) as an in-house artist, where he defined, tested, and abused their animation software as it was developed. Chris\'s work was a driving force behind Maya 1.0. During this period, Chris directed the end, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, and Bingo, which earned a Canadian Genie Award.\n\nChris then created and directed the animated short film Ryan (2004). It pioneered a style he calls "psychorealism," using surreal CG imagery to show the psychology of its characters. Ryan received the 2005 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, and over 60 other awards. In 2009, Chris released The Spine, a film nominated for a Canadian Genie award. His latest film is Subconscious Password, a psychological exploration of how we remember the names of old friends.\n\nChris continues to be obsessed with both new techniques in CG and new ways in telling stories with these techniques. An expert in facial animation, Chris developed a course called Making Faces, which he has taught at Dreamworks Animation, Seneca College, the University of Toronto, and the Ecole George Melies in Paris.', 'img'=> 'https://cdn.lynda.com/authors/6045234_250x250_thumb.jpg?v=1325717877'],
